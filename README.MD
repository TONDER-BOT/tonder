# TONDER

ZKP based Dating App with in-person meet up verification to prevent catfishing.

## Introduction

TONDER is an innovative dating app, which sits on the foundation of user credibility. Users will be asked to send a verification request when meeting with people in person, we used Zero Knowledge Proof technology to prove the meet-ups and store them in the Polygon chain. Users will maintain their credibility through the meet-up records and thus prevent catfishing. With TONDER, we will provide a worry-free dating experience.

## How it's made

The project uses World ID as the proof of personhood with zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP) technology and WalletConnect to connect Web3 wallets. The verification request is built using ZKP and smart contract stored on the Polygon Mumbai chain. We used React to develop the frontend application and the backend is built in Python Flask framework with SQLite database.
